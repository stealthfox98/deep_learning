# Deep learning projects

This repo contains some use cases where multilayered neural networks are used to simulate the complex decision-making power of the human brain.

Some types of models used:
* Convolutional Neural Netowrks (CNN) for i.e. computer vision and image classification
* Recurrent Neural Netowrks (RNN) for i.e. natural language and speech recognition

Common tech stack used:
* Programming language(s): Python, JavaScript
* Framework(s) used: Tensorflow, PyTorch, XGBoost (depending if CPU or GPU is used)
